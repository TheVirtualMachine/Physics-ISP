\chapter{Introducing the Forms of Transportation Used}
	In order to apply the mathematics previously developed and test the feasibility of skipping Donaldâ€™s presidency, we will be using four different forms of transportation.
	These forms vary from practical to theoretical, and have vastly different potential speeds and accelerations.

	It is important to note that we only care about the maximum speed for forms of transportation on earth, and we only care about acceleration for forms of transportation in space.
	The reasons for this will be made clear later on.
