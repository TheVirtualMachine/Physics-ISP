\section{Running}
	This first example of transport is the simplest and also the slowest.
	We will assume that Alice can run at a very high speed for an indefinite period of time.
	To find the maximum speed, we will be using the upper limit of human potential in sprinting, Usain Bolt.
	In Berlin in 2009, Bolt ran the 100m sprint in a world record time of 9.58 seconds \autocite{boltRunning}.
	Using the kinematics equation $v = \frac{\Del d}{\Del t}$, we can calculate Bolt's speed to be $\frac{\SI{100}{\metre}}{\SI{9.58}{\second}}$, or about \SI{10.44}{\metre/\second}.
