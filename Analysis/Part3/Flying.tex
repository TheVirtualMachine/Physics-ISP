\section{Flying}
	Our next form of transportation is significantly faster than running, but still relatively slow in the grand scheme of things. We will assume that Alice is flying around the earth, so we still only need to find maximum speed. We will also assume that Alice is able to maintain a very high speed indefinitely. The fastest aircraft in the world, the Lockheed Martin SR-71 Blackbird, can reach a maximum speed just over Mach 3 \autocite{aircraftSpeed}, or about \SI{1029}{\metre/\second}.
