\section{Using a black hole starship}
The process for finding the time Alice can skip in a black hole starship is essentially the same as for the space shuttle. We simply plug in the time until Donald is no longer president, and the acceleration of the starship. Recall that $\Del t_D = 99779400$ and that $a_{star\ ship} = \SI{17.407}{\metre/\second^2}$. The results are as follows:

For the curved path of the black hole starship, Alice is travelling in her frame of reference for \num{81349113} seconds, or about two years, six months, and 29 days. Alice skips about \SI{1.843028729e7}{\second} of Donald's presidency, or about seven months. Alice will arrive almost exactly at the time Donald's presidency ends.

As for the linear path, Alice is travelling in her frame of reference for \num{80311192} seconds, or about two years, six months, and 17 days. The amount of time Alice skips of Donald's presidency is about \SI{1.946821000e7}{\second}, or around seven months and twelve days. Alice will arrive approximately two seconds after Donald's last moments in office.

As was the case with the space shuttle, the linear path is more optimal than the curved path because Alice's elapsed time is smaller and the amount of time skipped is larger. The amount of time Alice skips while in the starship is notable, with a good chunk of Donald's presidency being shaved off. Should black hole starship travel be possible, this mode of transportation would be meaningful.
