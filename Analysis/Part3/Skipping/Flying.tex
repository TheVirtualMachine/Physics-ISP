\section{Flying}
	As with her running, Aliceâ€™s flying is done around the earth with relatively little acceleration time. Therefore, we can use the same equation that we used for running to calculate the amount of time skipped.

	\[\Del t_D = \text{Time remaining in Donald's presidency as of November 22, 2017} = \SI{99779400}{\second}\]
	\[v = \text{Speed of Alice's aircraft} = \SI{1029}{\metre/\second}\]
	\[\si{\clight} = \SI{299792458}{\metre/\second}\]
	\begin{align*}
		\Del t_S &= \num{99619200} - \num{99619200} \sqrt {1- \frac{1029^2}{299792458^2}}\\
		\Del t_S = \SI{5.8776e-4}{\second}
	\end{align*}
	As shown, if Alice flies in the fastest aircraft in the world for over three years straight, she will skip a total of slightly more than half a millisecond of time. This is much more conceivable than the amount of time skipped if she were running. Unfortunately for Alice, this mode of transportation is still not fast enough to be able to shave off a meaningful amount of time off the presidency.
