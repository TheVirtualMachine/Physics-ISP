\section{Minkowski spacetime and the twin paradox}
	Before we go further into the analysis, it is important to note that Donald and Alice do not necessarily need to be sending simple flashes of light once per second.
	They can also flash an image displaying the current time passed on their clock, and flash that image once per second.
	This has no effect on what happens, it just means that the other person doesn't need to perform as many calculations.
	We will assume that Alice and Donald are flashing an image of their clock, in order to make this section easier to follow.
	We will also assume that they both have telescopes strong enough to see the flashed image.
	\subsection{When does Donald see Alice's turnaround?}
		When Alice reaches her turnaround point, she is \SI{4}{\lightyear} away from Donald.
		This means that it will take 4 years for the light from the turnaround to reach him from this point.
		Donald can easily calculate when Alice \emph{should} reach the turnaround point though:
		\begin{align*}
			t &= \frac{d}{v}\\
			t &= \frac{\SI{4}{\lightyear}}{\SI{0.8}{\clight}}\\
			t &= \SI{5}{\year}
		\end{align*}
		Alice should reach the turnaround in 5 years, but Donald does not see that until 4 years after that, so he will see Alice's turnaround happen 9 years after her departure.

		Alice travels towards earth at the same speed she travels away from earth, so Donald can also calculate when Alice should get back:
		\begin{align*}
			t &= \frac{2d}{v}\\
			t &= \frac{\SI{8}{\lightyear}}{\SI{0.8}{\clight}}\\
			t &= \SI{10}{\year}
		\end{align*}
		The world lines as seen by Donald are shown in figure \vref{fig:donaldMinkowski}.

	\subsection{What does Alice see on Donald's clock at her turnaround?}
		It Alice's turnaround is \SI{4}{\lightyear} away, which means it takes \SI{4}{\year} for Donald's light flashes to reach that point.

		While Donald does not see Alice's turnaround until 9 years after her departure, he can calculate that it should happen 5 years after her departure.
		This means that when Alice reaches her turnaround point, she not will see any light flashes sent by Donald after the 1 year mark on his clock.

		When Alice is at her turnaround, she will see Donald's clock display 1 year, since the light from after that has not reached her yet.
		This means that Stella will observe figure \vref{fig:aliceInDonaldMinkowski} as the spacetime diagram according to Donald's clock.

	\subsection{What about Alice's clock?}
		Recall from our Doppler shift analysis from section \vref{sec:dopplerAnalysis} that Alice sees Donald's clock running at one third of its original speed as she is moving away from Donald, and she sees it moving at 3 times its original speed as she moves towards Donald.
