\section{Minkowski spacetime diagrams and world lines}
	We must now introduce a new way of analyzing problems in special relativity: the Minkowski spacetime diagrams and world lines.

	We will draw the world lines of our situation onto Minkowski spacetime diagrams.
	This is simply a diagram with time on the vertical axis, and distance on the horizontal axis.

	We will start with a spacetime diagram of what we would expect to see, disregarding special relativity, using Donald as the frame of reference. See Figure \ref{fig:classicalMinkowski}.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\begin{axis}[
					xlabel=$d\ (\si{\lightyear})$,
					ylabel=$t\ (\si{\year})$,
					xmin=0,
					xmax=4.25,
					ymin=0,
					ymax=10.75,
					xtick distance=1,
					ytick={0,5,10},
					height=4in,
					width=4in,
				]
				\addplot plot coordinates {
				(0,0)
				(4,5)
				(0,10)
				};
			\end{axis}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{Minkowski spacetime diagram of what we would expect to see according to classical physics with Donald as the frame of reference.}

	\end{figure}
	Of course, figure \ref{fig:classicalMinkowski} does not apply, since $\beta = 0.8$ (which is quite large), however, I find it helpful to visualize the problem and introduce the notion of spacetime diagrams.
