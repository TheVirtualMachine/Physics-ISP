\chapter*{Abstract}
	The purpose of this paper is to show that it is within the laws of physics to time travel one-way into the future, allowing us to avoid having to experience Donald Trump's presidency.

	First, Vincent Macri presents part \ref{part:twinParadox}, in which we solve the twin paradox without invoking general relativity, relying mainly on an analysis of the relativistic Doppler effect.

	Next, David White presents \ref{part:realWorld}, in which we derive the mathematics required to do a more practical analysis involving changes in direction.

	Lastly, Aviv Haber presents part \ref{part:trumpEscape}, in which we explore possible ways to actually travel into the future, ignoring the economic costs of each option, because costs are prohibitive to time travelling in practice.
