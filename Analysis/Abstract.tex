\chapter*{Abstract}
	We solve the twin paradox without invoking general relativity. The purpose of this is to show that it is within the laws of physics to build a one-way time machine to the future, allowing us to avoid having to experience Donald Trump's presidency. This part of the paper, part \ref{part:twinParadox} was written by Vincent Macri. We will mainly rely on an analysis of the relativistic Doppler effect.

	We then explore possible way to actually make a one-way time machine, ignoring the economic costs of actually creating one, as they will certainly be prohibitive to doing this in practice anyway. This part of the paper was written by David White and Aviv Haber.
