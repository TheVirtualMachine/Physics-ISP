\chapter{Work Equalization and Integration Summary}
	We believe it is best if everyone is involved with as many parts of the ISP as possible with the skills they have. Of course, some people are stronger at performing certain tasks than other tasks. Because of this, we will split up the work as follows:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Vincent] Vincent's main job will be preparing the documents and presentation. He will also do some calculations and research.
		\item[David] David will do most of the calculations, and some research.
		\item[Aviv] Aviv will do a lot of research, and will also proofread the paper, as well as check for any errors in our calculations. Aviv will also perform some of his own calculations.
	\end{description}
	Doing it this way, each group member should spend about an equal amount of time working on the project.

	As part of putting together the actual documents, Vincent will integrate everyone's work into a beautiful, coherent, professional \LaTeX{} document, as done in academia. This also has the benefits of: easier bibliography management, faster formula writing, and better presentation. Since we can also use \LaTeX{} for our presentation at the end, of the project, everything will have a clean, coherent look.
