This gives us the final equation **deltaT_T = 2deltat_1 + cancer**

It is not prossible to isolate for **deltat_1** in this equation, so we will have the computer approximate the value and calculate based
off that.

For the same reasons stated above, the time dilation over the time frame **deltat_1** is equal to the time dilation over the time frame
**deltat_3**. Given that the magnitude of velocity over the turn will be equal, we can calculate the time dilation over the time frame
**deltat_2** without summation. Thus, the simulator will only calculate the time dilation initial time step, then multiply by 2, then 
it will sum the result with the dilation over the timestep for the turn.
