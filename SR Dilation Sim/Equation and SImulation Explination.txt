Before making any calculations with velocity, we must first redefine our equation for velocity. Given that the speed of
light **(c)** is constant and is considered the "universal speed limit", it can be reasoned that **v=at** will no longer serve
as an accurate calculation for velocity since it can exceed c. Therefore we must use **v=c tanh(at/c)** as our equation for 
velocity, as it is the "true accceleration formula". (Gibbs, 1996).

For these calculations to be accurate, we must also assume that the earth is stationary, and that there are no other existing significant
gravitational masses other than the earth. Additionally, we must ignore gravitational time dilation.

It should also be noted that the dilation values calculated will be approximations calculated by a writen computer simulation. This
simulation will sum the time dilation across each 1 second interval for the entirety of the journey, which will not yeild a perfect
result, but the calculated result will be accurate enough for our purposes.

----------------------------------------LINEAR PATH----------------------------------------------------------

When traveling through space with acceleration, there are two possible basic paths that the travelling ship
can take. One is a linear shape as shown below.

[Diagram]

In this path, the ship will accelerate forward (away from the earth) in a straight line for a time **deltat_1**, then it will begin 
to decelerate at the same rate opposite to it's velocity for a time **deltat_2** until it reaches a halt. The ship will then 
accelerate backwards (towards the earth) in a straight line for a time **deltat_3**, and finally, it will decelerate for a time
**deltat_4** until it reaches a halt at it's starting position (position of the earth).

Given that the acceleration of the ship is constant, it is sufficient to say that **deltat_1 = deltat_2** since the 
ship must decelerate at the same rate at which it accelerates. Given this, it is also sufficient to say that **deltat_3 = deltat_4**.
We can also say that **deltad_1 + deltad_2 = deltad_3 + delta d_4** given that the distance traveled to and from the turning point
must be equal. This means that **deltat_1 + deltat_2 = deltat_3 + deltat_4** meaning: **deltat_1 = deltat_2 = deltat_3 = deltat_4**.

Since the acceleration and deceleration times are all equal: **deltaT_T = 4deltat_1**. 

Since the simulator will calculate the values using a summation technique, the time dilation over an accelerating timeframe will be 
equal to the time dilation over an equal timeframe decelerating with the same acceleration magnitude. This means that the time dilation
over the time frame **deltat_1** is equal to the dilation over the other three time frames, thus the simulator will only calculate
the dilation for the first time frame, and will multiply the result by 4 for the final dilation.


----------------------------------------TURNED PATH----------------------------------------------------------

The other option is for the ship to complete a circular turn to change directions. This can be modeled by the 
diagram below.

[Diagram]

In this path, the ship will accelerate forward (away from the earth) in a straight line for a time **deltat_1**

Using this diagram we can set up the following equation: **deltaT_T = deltat_1 + deltat_2 + deltat_3**.

As shown in the diagram, both **deltad_1** and **deltad_3** are tangent to the circle which models the turn, and pass through
the same point, being the position of the earth. As such, we can say that **deltat_1 = deltat_3** and **deltad_1 = deltad_3**.

We then get the following equation: **deltaT_T = 2deltat_1 + deltat_2**

We must solve for **deltat_2** in terms of **deltat_1** in order to get a workable equation, so we must set up the following set of 
equations:

[equations]

Using these equations we can substitute into **deltaT_T = 2deltat_1 + deltat_2** to get our final equation:

[steps]

This gives us the final equation **deltaT_T = 2deltat_1 + cancer**

It is not prossible to isolate for **deltat_1** in this equation, so we will have the computer approximate the value and calculate based
off that.

For the same reasons stated above, the time dilation over the time frame **deltat_1** is equal to the time dilation over the time frame
**deltat_3**. Given that the magnitude of velocity over the turn will be equal, we can calculate the time dilation over the time frame
**deltat_2** without summation. Thus, the simulator will only calculate the time dilation initial time step, then multiply by 2, then 
it will sum the result with the dilation over the timestep for the turn.

------------------------------------------------SIM RESULT----------------------------------------------------------
The simulator will use the above approximations for time dilation in each of the scenerios listed above to approximate the optimal
condition for each scenerio; being the trip time (the time relative to the astronaut) which yeilds an arrival within minutes of the
end of trump's presidency.

The simulator will provide the following information:
- The number of seconds between the end of trumps presidency and the arrival of the space ship.
- The trip time, the total time that the astronaut spends in the ship (relative to him)
- The total time that the astronaut spends in the ship (relative to people on earth)
- The total time skipped (the discrepency between the time the astronaut experiences and the time people on earth experience)
